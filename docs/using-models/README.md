# Using models

In the previous section we've tested the model that we trained. In this section
we'll take a look at how to use ML.NET models in ASP.NET Core.

We'll cover the following topics:

* Preparing the solution
* Loading models from disk
* Making a prediction

## Preparing the solution

In order to make a prediction we'll need a page in the web application that
allows the user to enter some test data. Since this is no an ASP.NET tutorial
we've gone ahead and prebuilt the page for you.

Copy the contents from the [src](../src/starter/Website) folder into the Website
project and build the project to make sure that the code works as expected.
